            <p><b>H</b>ello, my name is Mika Zukeyama, and I've been working as a full-stack web development intern at Nexul Academy.
                My focus during this internship has been on developing key features for the GuruFyre products, 
                specifically the 'checklist' functionality.
            </p>
            <p><b>T</b>he goal of my internship was to develop a robust checklist feature that enhances the user experience
                 within GuruFyreâ€™s educational platform. This feature enables students to efficiently manage their preparation tasks before beginning a lesson, 
                 ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

                <h3>Feature Objective:</h3>
                <p>The checklist feature is designed to display a list of useful knowledge 
                    and preparation items on the lesson page for students to know before 
                    starting the lesson. This feature aims to improve learning 
                    efficiency by helping students prepare and engage smoothly with the lesson content.

                    This checklist is embedded within the lesson page,

                <h3>UX/UI Considerations:</h3>
                <p>The design of the checklist feature focuses on simplicity and ease of use,
                    ensuring that users can navigate and utilize the feature without unnecessary complexity.
                    Angular Material components were used to maintain consistency with
                    the overall design of the GuruFyre platform.
