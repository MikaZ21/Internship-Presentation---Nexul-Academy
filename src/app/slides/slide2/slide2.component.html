        <p><b>H</b>ello, my name is Mika Zukeyama, and I've been working as a full-stack web development intern at Nexul Academy.
            My focus during this internship has been on developing key features for the GuruFyre products, 
            specifically the 'checklist' functionality.
        </p>
        <p><b>T</b>he goal of my internship was to develop an effective checklist feature that enhances the user experience
             on Guru Fyreâ€™s educational platform and ensuring seamless integration with the existing system. 
             This feature enables students to efficiently organize their preparation tasks before beginning a lesson.
